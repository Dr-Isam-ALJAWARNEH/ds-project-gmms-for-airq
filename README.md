# Use a Gaussian Mixture Models as a density estimator to generate new fine-grained air quality data

A density estimator is an algorithm which takes a D-dimensional dataset and produces an estimate of the D-dimensional probability distribution which that data is drawn from. The idea is to build a novel generative model using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to generate new big fine-grained air quality data for urban planning! Compare the results with those from Kernel Density Estimation (non-parametric estimator of density)
