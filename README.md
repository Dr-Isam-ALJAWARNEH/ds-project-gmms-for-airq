# Use a Gaussian Mixture Models as a density estimator to generate new fine-grained air quality data

- A density estimator is an algorithm which takes a D-dimensional dataset and produces an estimate of the D-dimensional probability distribution which that data is drawn from. The idea is to build a novel generative model using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to generate new big fine-grained air quality data for urban planning! Compare the results with those from Kernel Density Estimation (non-parametric estimator of density) 
### All tasks described in the instructions file are mandatory for this projcect, from task 1 to task 5, including Exploratory Data Analytics (EDA), stratified sampling, and density-based clustering using DBSCAN, in addition to writing a report discussing the obtained results, in at least four pages, IEEE conference format.
